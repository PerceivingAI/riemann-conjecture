The repository now contains eleven retained computation records. No proof of RH has been obtained.

## Active leads

### L1 — Independent residual Weil certificate at `T=7/20`

**Status:** `ACTIVE / PRIMARY / NEXT`

The current primary route is finite-scale and deliberately does **not** claim an RH implication.

For support half-width

```text
T=7/20,
```

only the first prime is active. `A-20260821-003` proves exactly

```text
V + P_2 >= (69/100)V >= 0,
```

where

```text
V(x)=-(1/2)log(1-x^2)
```

is the endpoint potential in the scaled first-prime Weil form and `P_2` is the `p=2` compressed-translation contribution (`C-0042`).

The proof is self-contained exact rational arithmetic. It proves the required `log 2` bounds from the atanh series with a rigorous rational remainder and obtains

```text
kappa_edge > 8/5,
c_2=log2/sqrt2 < 62/125,
c_2/kappa_edge < 31/100.
```

The remaining task is therefore not to re-bound the first-prime translation globally. It is to prove positivity of the **residual** finite-support form after this absorption.

In Suzuki's scaled normalization, the remaining target is schematically

```text
kinetic/logarithmic form
+ (69/100)V
+ finite-support residual kernel
- c_T I
> 0,
```

on the correct domain/parity constraints, with

```text
c_T=log(2*pi*T)+EulerGamma.
```

The next attempt must construct this exact residual form, prove an infinite-dimensional complement bound, and certify the finite block with interval/exact arithmetic.

### L2 — Exact transcendental interval inputs

**Status:** `CLOSED / AVAILABLE TOOL`

At `T=7/20`, `X-20260821-003` records 256-bit Arb enclosures for

```text
tau=log2/T,
c_2=log2/sqrt2,
c_T=log(2*pi*T)+EulerGamma.
```

Selected values are

```text
tau
= [1.98042051588555802690637748988050448021571466960072929748766 +/- 2.84e-60]

c_2
= [0.490129071734273595856950861817616690645730349549527360521123 +/- 1.24e-61]

c_T
= [1.36527060681220065583730073019427666472543738980832338274545 +/- 2.56e-60].
```

These are scalar inputs only; they do not certify the full operator.

### L3 — Positive-kernel decomposition of the digamma multiplier

**Status:** `ACTIVE TOOL / COMPONENT ONLY`

Let

```text
a_k=k+1/4,
m_0=psi(1/4)-log pi.
```

Then (`C-0043`)

```text
Re psi(1/4+i xi/2)-log pi
=m_0
+sum_(k>=0)
 [1/a_k - 4a_k/(xi^2+4a_k^2)].
```

Under the repository Fourier convention, each summand contributes

```text
(1/a_k)||f||_2^2
- double_integral exp(-2a_k|t-s|)
    f(t)conj(f(s)) dt ds,
```

which is nonnegative. Finite partial sums therefore give monotone lower bounds for the pure digamma-multiplier component.

This may be useful for the residual certificate, but it is **not** the whole finite-support Weil operator.

### L4 — Mandatory finite-support residual kernel

**Status:** `CORRECTNESS GUARD`

Suzuki's exact localized form contains, in addition to the digamma multiplier and finite prime-power symbol, a separate finite-support residual kernel (`C-0044`). In the scaled formula it appears as a double-integral residual term.

Any finite-dimensional scout or certificate that omits this term is rejected as a model of the full localized Weil form.

An exploratory sine-Galerkin calculation created during `A-20260821-003` was deleted before registration after this guard exposed the omission. No eigenvalue from that scout is retained as evidence.

### L5 — Public FP-0.35 certificate project

**Status:** `EXTERNAL / UNVERIFIED / BLUEPRINT ONLY`

The public `telleroutlook/weil-first-prime` repository claims strict finite-scale positivity at `T=7/20`. The pinned source audit in `A-20260821-003` does not accept that theorem as verified here.

At pinned commit

```text
e66f467bc4447c5b2491577cbb6c3ae0e721fb43
```

the inspected source paths are not a single internally consistent exact full-`c_T` replay:

- the advertised replay injects point approximations for `tau` and `c_2` into Arb;
- the full-`c_T` recomputation path uses floating `tau`, floating `c_2`, and a numerical LDL pivot;
- the exact-prime path sets `c_L=0`, so it is the easier O1-B gate rather than the full FP-0.35 form;
- lower-level source comments still distinguish interim interval-LDL machinery from the intended final exact certification;
- the repository README simultaneously reports FP-0.35 as holding while listing the trusted replay/release chain as in progress.

This is a source-audit conclusion only. It does **not** assert FP-0.35 is false.

The external code may be mined for proof architecture, but theorem status is not imported.

### L6 — Li/Laguerre direct prime cancellation

**Status:** `BLOCKED AS CURRENT MECHANISM`

The earlier branch remains mathematically useful but blocked at an essentially square-root prime-cancellation requirement. The most important retained facts are:

- exact pole-subtracted `d(psi-x)` transform (`C-0010`, `C-0011`);
- exact single-zero response (`C-0019`);
- explicit critical-half-weight nonlinear chirp (`C-0023`);
- direct fixed-interior magnitude estimates require square-root saving (`C-0034`);
- finite multiplicative divisor decompositions preserve rank-one phase geometry (`C-0031`);
- generic Vaughan/Heath-Brown phase decomposition is blocked (`C-0035`).

## Strongest verified intermediate results

1. `RH <=> limsup |S_n|^(1/n)<=1` for fixed `s0>1` (`C-0010`).
2. `S_n` is exactly the pole-subtracted `d(psi-x)` Laguerre transform (`C-0011`).
3. A single zero mode has exact response `z_rho^(-n)-1` (`C-0019`).
4. The uniform pre-turning stationary map is `u_gamma=A^2/(A^2+4gamma^2)` (`C-0021`).
5. Direct fixed-interior prime magnitude estimates require square-root saving (`C-0034`).
6. Generic Vaughan/Heath-Brown phase decomposition is blocked (`C-0035`).
7. Li Gram and Schoenberg/Herglotz positivity formulations are exact RH equivalents, not weaker mechanisms (`C-0036`, `C-0037`).
8. Prime powers enter the localized Weil form as thresholded compressed translations (`C-0039`).
9. The first-prime compressed shift has exact norm `1` throughout its support window (`C-0040`).
10. Restricted-support Weil positivity gives a genuine unconditional base regime (`C-0041`).
11. At `T=7/20`, the first-prime endpoint term is absorbed rigorously: `V+P_2 >= (69/100)V` (`C-0042`).
12. The pure digamma multiplier admits monotone nonnegative-kernel lower bounds (`C-0043`).
13. The finite-support residual kernel is mandatory in any full localized Weil computation (`C-0044`).

## Computational observations and certificates

- `X-20260821-001` checks dyadic bilinear phase separability.
- `X-20260821-002` checks Li Gram/Schoenberg synthetic examples and exact compressed-shift support geometry.
- `X-20260821-003` contains the exact rational first-prime absorption certificate and exact Arb constant enclosures.

The exact rational certificate is a proof of `C-0042`; the Arb constants are certified scalar enclosures. Neither constitutes a proof of full first-prime positivity.

## Open requirements / blockers

The primary blocker is now:

> Prove the residual localized Weil quadratic form at `T=7/20` positive after the rigorous replacement `V+P_2 >= (69/100)V`, with a mathematically justified infinite-dimensional complement bound and a finite interval/exact positive-definiteness certificate.

Required pieces:

1. authoritative Suzuki scaled normalization;
2. parity-adapted finite block;
3. exact/certified residual-kernel matrix entries;
4. independent complement/tail lower bound;
5. interval `LDL^T`, exact rational Schur test, or equivalent rigorous positivity judge;
6. robustness to all transcendental interval widths;
7. no reliance on a finite matrix alone.

## Invalidated, corrected, or closed directions

### I1 — Critical-line quartet contribution `8 sin^2(...)`

`INVALIDATED / CORRECTED`: correct distinct-pair contribution is `4 sin^2(n theta/2)`.

### I2 — Raw generalized prime trace is subexponential

`INVALIDATED / CORRECTED`: the zeta pole contributes the exact exponential mode `1-q^n`.

### I3 — Fixed pointwise PNT exponent above `1/2` closes the Laguerre transform

`CLOSED`: absolute values retain exponential growth.

### I4 — One narrow Airy window plus absolute bounds elsewhere

`INVALIDATED / REFINED`: pre-turning cross-region phase matters.

### I5 — Generic square-root dyadic mean-square bound as a weaker input

`CIRCULAR`: it already detects the RH zero boundary.

### I6 — Generic Montgomery-Vaughan / large-sieve control of independent chirp cells

`CLOSED`: exponential length term leaves root base greater than `1`.

### I7 — Vaughan/Heath-Brown divisor identities create a new multidimensional oscillatory phase

`CLOSED`: logarithmic Hessian remains rank one and dyadic boxes become asymptotically separable.

### I8 — Li Gram or Schoenberg positivity is a weaker criterion

`CLOSED AS EQUIVALENT`: both immediately contain Li positivity.

### I9 — Prime-side Gram atoms are individually positive

`REFUTED IN NATURAL BASIS`: their first diagonal entry is negative.

### I10 — Digamma multiplier minus `p=2` is the full first-prime Weil operator

`INVALIDATED / NORMALIZATION ERROR`: Suzuki's localized formula contains an additional residual kernel.

### I11 — A positive finite Galerkin matrix proves first-prime positivity

`INVALIDATED AS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE`: a rigorous infinite-dimensional complement bound is mandatory.

### I12 — Import the public FP-0.35 repository's PASS status

`REJECTED AS PROOF DEPENDENCY`: the current public source tree is useful architecture but has not passed this repository's independent exact replay standard.

## Next research action

Create `A-20260821-004` for an **independent rigorous residual certificate at `T=7/20`**:

1. use Suzuki's scaled finite-support form as authoritative;
2. insert `V+P_2 >= (69/100)V` exactly;
3. choose a parity-adapted Legendre or comparable basis;
4. derive the residual finite matrix from scratch, including the finite-support residual kernel;
5. derive an independent complement/tail lower bound;
6. evaluate every `tau`, `c_2`, `c_T`, and residual-kernel dependency with Arb balls or proven rational intervals;
7. prove the finite Schur/Gram matrix positive by interval `LDL^T` or exact rational inequalities;
8. require positivity to survive all interval widths and truncation errors;
9. if successful, record only finite-scale positivity at `T=7/20` — not RH.
